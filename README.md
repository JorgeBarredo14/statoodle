2) Be sure you installed PyInstaller previously! If you didn't, do this:
   cd Users\#YourUser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts or move to the folder where Python is installed
   pip install pyinstaller
  
3) Then, execute the following commands in order to generate your executable:
   cd Users\#YourUser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts or move to the folder where Python is installed
   pyinstaller ThePathRouteWhereYouDownloadedTheFiles\statoodle.py -n="Statoodle" --onefile --noconsole --icon "icon.ico" --add-data "*.png;." --hidden-import=’matplotlib’;’seaborn’;’pandas’;’fpdf’
